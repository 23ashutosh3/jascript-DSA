üß† What is a Set?
A Set is a collection of unique values. That means:
No duplicates are allowed
The order of insertion is preserved
Values can be of any type (primitive or object)

It behaves like a hash set in other programming languages ‚Äî i.e., it uses hashing under the hood for fast access.


‚úÖ Why Use a Set?
To store unique items (no duplicates)
To perform operations like:
Checking if a value exists (fast)
Removing duplicates from arrays
Efficient set operations (like union, intersection)

const mySet = new Set();

const numbers = new Set([1, 2, 3, 3, 4]);
console.log(numbers); // Set(4)¬†{1, 2, 3, 4} ‚Üí duplicates removed


<!-- Iteration -->
const set = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
for (const value of set) {
  console.log(value); // 1, 2, 3
}

<!-- using For each -->
set.forEach((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});

<!-- üß† Does a Set have keys or values? -->
‚úîÔ∏è Short Answer:

A Set has values only
But internally, it treats each value as both the key and value
That's why in the .forEach() callback, the key and value are the same:

const set = new Set(["a", "b"]);
set.forEach((value, key) => {
  console.log(`Key: ${key}, Value: ${value}`);
});
# Output:
# Key: a, Value: a
# Key: b, Value: b


const set = new Set();
set.add("apple");
set.add("banana");
set.add("apple"); // ignored

console.log(set); // Set(2)¬†{"apple", "banana"}
console.log(set.has("banana")); // true
console.log(set[0]); // undefined (no index access)

1. How to convert a Set (hash-based structure) into an Array?
const mySet = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// Method 1: Using spread operator
const arr1 = [...mySet];

// Method 2: Using Array.from
const arr2 = Array.from(mySet);

console.log(arr1); // ["a", "b", "c"]
console.log(arr2); // ["a", "b", "c"]


üîé 2. How to Get the Index of an Element in a Set?

    Sets in JavaScript do not support indexing
    There‚Äôs no set[0] or .indexOf()
    So to find the index, you must convert the Set to an Array first

    const mySet = new Set(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);
    const arr = [...mySet];
    const index = arr.indexOf("banana");
    console.log(index); // 1


üîç How to access key-value pairs of objects inside a Set?

You need to iterate through the Set, and for each element, check if it‚Äôs an object, then read its properties.

const obj1 = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const obj2 = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };
const set = new Set([obj1, obj2]);

for (const item of set) {
  if (typeof item === "object") {
    console.log("Name:", item.name);
    console.log("Age:", item.age);
  }
}


If you want to check for objects inside a Set by value (not by reference), you have two options:

const set = new Set([{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }]);
const exists = [...set].some(obj => obj.id === 2);
console.log(exists); // ‚úÖ true



üß© What is a Hash Table?

A hash table (or hash map) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides fast average-time access to values by their keys.

üîç How Does It Work?

Hash Function:
Takes a key (could be a string, number, object) and computes a hash code ‚Äî a fixed-size integer that represents the key.
Index Calculation:
The hash code is transformed (usually by modulo operation) into an index that fits within an internal array (called buckets).
Bucket Array:
The hash table has an array of buckets where the key-value pairs are stored.
Collision Handling:
Sometimes different keys produce the same hash index ‚Üí called a collision. We handle this via:
Chaining: Each bucket holds a linked list or array of entries with the same hash.
Open Addressing: If a bucket is occupied, find the next available bucket (probing).


| Bucket Index | Stored Entries (linked list or array)                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | (empty)                                                       |
| 1            | `[["apple", "fruit"]]`                                        |
| 2            | `[["banana", "fruit"], ["carrot", "vegetable"]]` (collision!) |
| 3            | (empty)                                                       |
| 4            | `[["date", "fruit"]]`                                         |
| 5            | (empty)                                                       |
